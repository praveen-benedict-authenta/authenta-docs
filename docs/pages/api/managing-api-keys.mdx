## What Are API Keys?

API keys are credentials that identify and authorize you when making requests to Authenta’s API.

Each key contains:

- **Client ID** → Acts as the public identifier
- **Client Secret** → A private secret used to authenticate
- **Assigned permissions**
- **Allocated Query quota**
- **Allocated Mutation quota**

> ⚠️ The **client secret is shown only once** when the key is created.  
> You must store it securely — Authenta does _not_ display it again.

## Where to Manage API Keys

Navigate to:

**Settings → API Access → API Keys**

Here you will see:

- A list of your existing keys
- Their assigned permissions
- Usage of quota per key
- Options to create or revoke keys

If you have no keys yet, you will see a **Generate API Key** button.

## Creating a New API Key

Click **Generate API Key** to open the creation dialog.  
You will be prompted to configure:

### 1. Key Name

A label used to help you identify the purpose of the key.

Examples:

- `Backend-Server-Key`
- `Mobile-App-Key`
- `Video-Pipeline-Key`

### 2. Permissions

Authenta supports the following permission types:

| Permission | Allows                                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Read**   | Fetching media, viewing metadata (`GET`) |
| **Write**  | Uploading media (`POST`)                 |
| **Delete** | Removing media (`DELETE`)                |

Permissions restrict which API operations a key may perform.  
If a key does not have the required permission, requests will return:

```

403 — Forbidden (You are not authorized)

```

### 3. Quota Allocation (Per Key)

Since quotas are assigned **per-user**, each API key can use only a portion of your total:

- **Query quota**
- **Mutation quota**

You can choose how much of your available quota to allocate to a specific key.

Examples:

| Total User Quota       | Key Allocation Example |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 60 Query / 40 Mutation | Key A → 20Q / 10M      |
|                        | Key B → 40Q / 30M      |

Once allocated, the key cannot exceed its assigned quota.  
If it does, the API returns:

```

429 — Quota Exceeded

```

## Viewing API Keys

After a key is created, you will see:

- Key name
- Client ID
- Permissions
- Query quota usage
- Mutation quota usage
- Date created
- Options to manage the key

### Viewing the Client Secret

After creation, the **client secret is not shown again**.  
If you lose the secret:

- You must **regenerate** it
- The previous secret becomes invalid immediately

## Regenerating the Client Secret

If your secret has been lost or compromised:

1. Open the key details
2. Click **Regenerate Secret**
3. Copy the new secret immediately
4. Update your services to use the new secret

A regenerated secret:

- Invalidates the old secret
- Does **not** change your Client ID
- Does **not** reset key-level quotas
- Does **not** affect your usage history

## Revoking an API Key

If a key is no longer needed:

1. Open the key details
2. Click **Revoke Key**
3. Confirm the action

Revoking a key:

- Immediately invalidates both Client ID & Client Secret
- Prevents all further requests using that key
- Does not delete historical usage or logs
- Frees previously allocated quota back to your user account (optional depending on UI behavior)

You may revoke a key at any time for security or cleanup purposes.

## Best Practices for API Keys

To maintain secure and stable integrations:

### 🔒 1. Store Secrets Securely

Use environment variables, secret managers, or encrypted credential stores.  
Never hard-code secrets into your source code.

### 🚫 2. Do Not Share API Keys

Keys are tied to your **user account**.  
Sharing keys means sharing access to your quota and credits.

### 🔄 3. Rotate Keys Regularly

Regenerate secrets periodically to reduce long-term exposure risk.

### 🎯 4. Use Separate Keys for Separate Systems

Examples:

- One key for your backend server
- Another for automated batch processing
- Another for testing environments

This gives you fine-grained control and safer isolation.

### 📉 5. Monitor Quota Usage

Regularly review how your keys consume:

- Query quota
- Mutation quota
- Credits (for media processing)

If your integrations grow, consider increasing your user-level quota.

## Next Steps

Once your key is created and configured:

- [Learn how to **authenticate API calls**](/api/authentication)
- [Start making **media requests**](/api/making-api-calls)
- [View endpoint details in the **Media API Reference**](/api/reference/media)

Managing API keys correctly ensures secure and reliable access to the Authenta API.
