# Authenta API Overview

Authenta provides a secure, scalable API that allows customers to integrate deepfake-detection capabilities directly into their own applications and services.  
With API access enabled, you can programmatically upload media, check analysis results, and manage previously processed items using authenticated and quota-controlled API calls.

The Authenta API is designed for organizations that require automated or large-scale media validation workflows beyond what is available in the Authenta web console.

## Why Use the Authenta API?

Authenta’s API enables you to:

- **Automate deepfake detection** pipelines in your internal systems
- **Upload media programmatically** for evaluation
- **Fetch results and metadata** without using the UI
- **Integrate trust & safety checks** directly into your product
- **Manage media lifecycle** (upload, fetch, delete)

The API uses the same detection engine and produces the same results as the Authenta platform—just accessible via secure endpoints.

## High-Level Workflow

API access is not immediately available by default.  
Instead, the access flow is:

1. **User requests API access** from their Authenta console → Settings → API Access
2. **User submits expected Query & Mutation quotas**
3. **Authenta Admin reviews the request**
4. Once approved, the user can:
   - Generate **API keys** (Client ID & Client Secret)
   - Allocate quotas per key
   - Start using the API

## Authentication Model

All API calls require two headers:

```http
x-client-id: <your_client_id>
x-client-secret: <your_client_secret>
```

These are generated after your API access is approved.
The **client secret is shown only once**, so make sure to store it securely.

Authenta uses a simple header-based authentication system suitable for on-prem and SaaS environments. No OAuth or session tokens are required.

## API Operations & Request Types

Authenta internally classifies requests into two types:

### **Query Requests**

- Correspond to `GET` routes
- Used for reading data
  Examples:

  - Fetch all media
  - Fetch a media item by ID

### **Mutation Requests**

- Correspond to `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` routes
- Used for modifying data
  Examples:

  - Upload media
  - Delete media

Your allowed quotas for these two types determine how many API calls you can make.

## Quotas

When requesting API access, users must specify:

- **Mutation Quota**
  (How many POST/PUT/DELETE operations you need)

- **Query Quota**
  (How many GET operations you expect)

**The Query Quota must be at least 1.5× the Mutation Quota.**

Example:

| Type     | Example Value |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Mutation | 30            |
| Query    | 45+           |

These quotas are applied at the **account level**, and you can allocate portions of them to individual API keys.

When your quota is exhausted:

- Further requests return **HTTP 429 (Quota Exceeded)**
- You must request a quota increase from the Authenta console

## Credits System

Authenta uses a credit-based billing system for all media operations.

- When you upload or process media **via the API**, credits are consumed
- Credit deduction happens exactly the same way as when using the Authenta UI
- Query-only endpoints (such as fetching metadata) **do not** consume credits

Credits and quotas operate independently:

| Resource    | Purpose                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Credits** | Charged for media processing                   |
| **Quotas**  | Limit the number of API calls (query/mutation) |

A user can have available API quota but insufficient credits required for processing.

## TypeScript API Types

Authenta ships first-class TypeScript types describing all API request and response structures.
These types are included in the `api-types.d.ts` file and define:

- Media object shapes
- Upload request body schema
- Detection metadata
- Error responses
- Pagination types
- API route definitions

This ensures type-safe usage for integrations built in TypeScript or Node.js.
(If needed, you can import these types directly into your application.)

## Supported API Endpoints

The current set of public API routes includes:

- **POST `/api/media`** — Upload Media _(Mutation)_
- **GET `/api/media`** — Fetch All Media _(Query)_
- **GET `/api/media/{mid}`** — Fetch One Media _(Query)_
- **DELETE `/api/media/{mid}`** — Delete Media _(Mutation)_

Full details are available in [References](/api/reference/media)

## Next Steps

To begin integrating the API:

1. [Continue to **Requesting API Access**](/api/api-access)
2. [Then **Generate API Keys**](/api/managing-api-keys)
3. [Finally, follow **Using the API**](/api/making-api-calls)

Authenta’s API enables powerful automated trust-analysis workflows, and this section of the documentation will guide you through each step of the integration.
