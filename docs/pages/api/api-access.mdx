# Requesting API Access

Authenta API access is not enabled by default.  
Each **user** must explicitly request access from the Authenta Console, specify their expected usage quotas, and wait for approval from the Authenta admin team.

This page explains the complete workflow for requesting and activating API access for a user.

## What Is API Access?

API access allows a user to:

- Upload media programmatically
- Fetch analysis results without using the UI
- Integrate deepfake detection into their own applications or scripts
- Manage media lifecycle (create, read, delete) through HTTP endpoints

Once your request is approved, you will be able to create API keys (Client ID & Client Secret) and begin making authenticated API calls.

## Where to Request API Access

You can request access directly from the Authenta Console:

**Settings → API Access**

On this page, you’ll see:

- Your user details
- Your available credits
- Your current API access status
- Fields to configure your API quotas

If API access has not been requested yet, you will see a **Request API Access** button.

## Submitting an API Access Request

When requesting API access, you must provide two quota values:

### 1. Mutation Quota

The number of **write** operations you expect to perform.  
This covers the following HTTP methods:

- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `DELETE`

These are operations that create or modify resources.

Examples:

- Uploading a media file
- Deleting a media record

### 2. Query Quota

The number of **read-only** operations you expect to perform.  
This covers:

- `GET` requests

Examples:

- Fetching all media
- Fetching details of a specific media item

## Quota Requirements

To keep the system predictable and stable, Authenta enforces the following rule:

> **Query Quota must be at least 1.5 × Mutation Quota.**

Examples:

| Mutation Quota | Minimum Query Quota |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| 20             | 30                  |
| 40             | 60                  |
| 100            | 150                 |

If the Query Quota does not satisfy this rule, the console will show a validation error and you will need to adjust the values.

## Request Status

After you submit the request, your API access will move through these statuses:

### **PENDING**

- Your request has been submitted
- Awaiting review by the Authenta admin team

### **APPROVED**

- You can now generate API keys
- Your user-level Query and Mutation quotas are active
- You can start integrating the API

### **REJECTED** (rare)

- The provided information was not sufficient or appropriate
- Credits may be insufficient
- Other policy or usage concerns

If your request is rejected, you can review the reason (if provided) and submit a new request with updated details.

## What Happens After Approval?

When your API access request is approved:

1. Your **Query** and **Mutation** quotas are assigned to **your user account**
2. The API Access page will show your active quotas and usage
3. A **Generate API Key** (or similar) action becomes available
4. You can create API credentials:
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret** (shown only once)
5. You can begin making authenticated API calls using your keys

Approval gives your **user account** the ability to use the API within the limits of:

- Your **Query quota**
- Your **Mutation quota**
- Your available **credits**

Each media upload still consumes credits, just like it does when using the Authenta UI.

## Editing or Increasing Your Quotas

If your usage grows over time, you can request higher limits:

1. Go to **Settings → API Access**
2. Open your existing API access configuration
3. Click **Request Increase** (or equivalent action)
4. Enter new Mutation and Query quota values
5. Submit for admin approval

Quota increases follow the same rule:

> **Query Quota ≥ 1.5 × Mutation Quota**

Your updated request will again go through the PENDING → APPROVED/REJECTED flow.

## API Access Scope & Limitations

API access is granted **per user**, and currently:

- Quotas are tracked per user account
- Each user manages their own API keys
- Usage (queries, mutations, credits) is attributed to the user who owns the keys

## Next Steps

Once your API access is approved:

- [Generate API Keys](/api/managing-api-keys)
- [Learn how Authentication works](/api/authentication)
- [Start making API calls](/api/making-api-calls)
- [Check endpoint details](/api/reference/media)

Requesting API access is the first step to integrating Authenta’s deepfake detection engine into your own tools and workflows.
