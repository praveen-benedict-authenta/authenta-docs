# Support & Assistance

## Overview

The Authenta team is committed to helping your organization deploy, operate, and maintain the **Authenta On-Prem** system securely and efficiently.  
This page explains how to contact our support team, what information to include when reporting issues, and the scope of assistance available.

Our engineering and DevOps specialists work directly with enterprise clients to ensure that each deployment meets security, performance, and compliance standards.

## Receiving Authenta Registry Credentials

Authenta’s container images are hosted in a **private AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** under Authenta’s own AWS account.  
To access these images, your DevOps team will need the following information:

- The **Authenta AWS Account ID**, which identifies Authenta’s private ECR registry.
- **Read-only ECR credentials** that allow your organization to authenticate and pull container images securely.

These credentials are **issued privately** to verified enterprise clients during onboarding.  
They are distributed through a secure channel (e.g., encrypted email or customer portal) and can be rotated upon request.

If your team has not yet received Authenta’s registry credentials, or if you need them reissued, please contact: **support@authenta.ai**

> ⚠️ The ECR credentials provided by Authenta are read-only and scoped exclusively for image pulls. They do not grant any write, push, or management permissions to Authenta’s registry.

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> Do not share or reuse these credentials outside your deployment environment. Authenta may rotate credentials periodically for security compliance.
