# Prerequisites

## Overview

Before installing **Authenta On-Prem**, ensure that your system meets the hardware, software, and network prerequisites listed below.  
These requirements are designed to guarantee stable performance, successful image pulls, and full offline operation after setup.

## 1. System Requirements

Authenta supports both **CPU** and **GPU** environments.  
Hardware specifications vary based on the volume of media processed and desired inference speed.

### ✅ Minimum Recommended Hardware

| Component          | Requirement                                    | Notes                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU**            | 8-core Intel Xeon / AMD EPYC (or higher)       | Required for CPU-only inference                    |
| **GPU (optional)** | NVIDIA GPU with ≥8GB VRAM (Tesla / RTX series) | Required for GPU-accelerated mode                  |
| **Memory (RAM)**   | 16 GB minimum (32 GB recommended)              | For concurrent processing and caching              |
| **Storage**        | 100 GB free disk space                         | For Docker images, logs, and temporary media files |
| **Network**        | Temporary internet access                      | Only required once to pull images from AWS ECR     |
| **OS**             | Ubuntu 20.04+ / CentOS 8+ / Amazon Linux 2     | 64-bit Linux recommended                           |

> 💡 **Tip:** For production deployments or large-scale workloads, allocate dedicated GPU resources and SSD storage for improved throughput.

## 2. Software Requirements

Authenta relies on standard container and CLI tooling.  
Ensure the following software is installed on your host system:

| Software                            | Purpose                                                | Installation Reference                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docker Engine (v20.10 or newer)** | Runs all Authenta containers.                          | [Install Docker Engine →](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)                                    |
| **Docker Compose (v2.5 or newer)**  | Orchestrates Authenta services.                        | [Install Docker Compose →](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)                                  |
| **AWS CLI (v2 or newer)**           | Required for authentication to Authenta’s private ECR. | [Install AWS CLI v2 →](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) |
| **Node.js (v16+ optional)**         | Runs the sample demo application.                      | [Node.js Downloads →](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)                                                |

> ⚙️ Verify your installations:
>
> ```bash
> docker --version
> docker compose version
> aws --version
> ```

## 3. GPU Environment (Optional)

If you plan to use GPU acceleration (`ml-task-runner-gpu` profile), you must install and configure the **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** and related drivers.

### Required Components

| Dependency                   | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NVIDIA Driver**            | Must match your GPU model and CUDA version. The driver requirement is described in NVIDIA’s installation guide — follow it closely. |
| **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** | Enables Docker containers to access and utilize GPU resources. Must also be configured for Docker runtime integration.              |

Follow NVIDIA’s official setup and configuration guide:  
👉 [Install and Configure NVIDIA Container Toolkit →](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> The toolkit installation guide includes a step to **enable GPU support in Docker** (by configuring the NVIDIA runtime in Docker’s settings). Make sure to complete this step — Authenta’s GPU containers require Docker to recognize the NVIDIA runtime. Skipping this configuration will cause GPU-enabled containers to fail at startup.

Once installation and configuration are complete, you can validate your GPU environment using NVIDIA’s own sample workload:  
👉 [Run NVIDIA Sample Workload →](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/sample-workload.html)

Authenta does not require any additional verification beyond the steps in NVIDIA’s documentation.

## 4. Network & Access Requirements

Authenta operates fully offline after setup, but you'll need limited internet access initially to pull Docker images from our private AWS registry.

### Required During Setup

| Item                     | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Outbound Internet Access | Needed only once to pull container images. Can be disabled afterward     |
| AWS ECR Credentials      | Provided by Authenta. Used for secure login and image pull               |
| Ports                    | Internal communication only (RabbitMQ: 5672 / 15672 for dashboard)       |
| Firewall Rules           | Allow local container-to-container communication over the Docker network |

⚠️ After installation, you may safely disable outbound internet and lock down ports for air-gapped operation.

## 5. File System & Storage Setup

Authenta requires a shared host directory that is mounted into containers for data exchange.

| Path                 | Purpose                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `/opt/authenta/data` | Stores input files and inference outputs           |
| `/opt/authenta/logs` | (Optional) Capture logs for auditing or monitoring |

Ensure that:

- The directory exists before starting the containers
- Proper permissions are assigned (e.g., `chmod 775 /opt/authenta/data`)
- Sufficient disk space is available for temporary media storage

## 6. Access Permissions

To deploy Authenta, the executing user must have:

- Docker permissions (part of the `docker` group)
- Read/Write access to shared data and log directories
- Network access (for initial setup only)
- **Authenta Registry Access:** Authenta will provide your team with the AWS Account ID and temporary ECR credentials needed to pull images from Authenta’s private registry.

## 7. Optional Tools (for Debugging or Integration)

While not mandatory, the following tools are useful during setup or testing:

| Tool                       | Purpose                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Postman / curl             | Test message publishing to RabbitMQ or APIs |
| Docker Desktop / Portainer | Visual management of containers and logs    |
| jq                         | JSON parsing utility for log inspection     |

## Summary

| Category       | Requirement                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hardware       | 8-core CPU, 16–32 GB RAM, 100 GB storage                |
| GPU (optional) | NVIDIA GPU with drivers + container toolkit             |
| Software       | Docker, Docker Compose, AWS CLI                         |
| Network        | One-time internet access for ECR image pull             |
| Permissions    | Docker group membership + directory access              |
| OS             | 64-bit Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, CentOS 8+, Amazon Linux 2) |
