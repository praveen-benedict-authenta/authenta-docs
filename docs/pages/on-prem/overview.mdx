# Overview

## What is Authenta?

**Authenta** is an AI-powered media authenticity platform that detects **deepfakes, AI-generated images, and image forgeries** with industry-leading precision.  
It helps organizations verify the integrity of visual content before publication, storage, or legal processing.

The **Authenta On-Prem Edition** is designed for enterprises and government agencies that require **complete data control**.  
It can be deployed entirely inside your infrastructure — operating **fully offline** once installed — ensuring that sensitive media never leaves your network.

Authenta leverages deep neural models trained on large-scale datasets to identify manipulation patterns in both video and image files.  
It integrates easily with your internal applications through **RabbitMQ** or a lightweight **REST adapter**.

## Key Features

- 🔒 **Data Sovereignty** — All media files, results, and logs stay within your infrastructure.
- 🧠 **AI-Based Detection** — Specialized models detect deepfakes, synthetic images, and forged regions.
- ⚙️ **Flexible Deployment** — Delivered as Docker containers with support for CPU and GPU profiles.
- 🚫 **Offline Operation** — Requires internet only once for image pull; operates fully air-gapped afterward.
- 🧩 **Modular Components** — RabbitMQ message broker, ML inference runner, and shared storage volume.
- 📈 **Scalable by Design** — Deploy multiple inference containers for parallel job processing.
- 🔐 **No Telemetry** — No external communication, tracking, or analytics.
- 🧾 **Compliant** — Meets on-prem data isolation and enterprise security standards.

## Supported Models

| Model    | Input Type | Description                                             | Status |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **DF-1** | Video      | Detects deepfake or manipulated faces in video content. | Stable |
| **AC-1** | Image      | Determines if an image was AI-generated or synthetic.   | Stable |
| **FD-1** | Image      | Detects forged or tampered regions within an image.     | Beta   |

Each model can be selected dynamically when publishing a task to RabbitMQ.  
All inference operations occur locally within your environment — no cloud calls or external processing are involved.

## Offline & Secure Operation

Authenta’s architecture is designed for **air-gapped, high-security environments**:

- All components (RabbitMQ, inference runner, shared storage) run locally as Docker services.
- The system communicates only within your internal network.
- No telemetry, logging, or model updates are sent externally.
- Internet connectivity is required **only once** — to pull container images from Authenta’s private AWS ECR.
- After setup, the system can function indefinitely offline.

You may safely **disable outbound network access** or enforce firewall restrictions once setup is complete.
